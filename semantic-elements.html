    <h1>My Favorite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
    <h2>DC Heroes</h2>
    <p><em>DC heroes comics are the best.</em><br>
      The storylines are more complex, and <u>often address real world issues.</u> My favorite is <strong>Green Arrow.</strong></p>

    <h3><small>Marvel Heroes are whatever</small></h3>
    <p><q>Marvel superheroe comics feel more 2 dimensional</q> However, Marvel is really killing it in the film and TV industry.</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <blockquote>To summarize, Marvel heroes are not as cool as DC heroes.</blockquote>
    <p> But they do have decent movies and TV shows for whatever that's worth.</p>
